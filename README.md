# CMPG323
## CMPG323 IT Implementations.

<h2>Welcome to the CMPG323 Projects Overview<h2/>

<h2>Here you can find a layout of the projects needed for this module<h2/>

5 Repositories will be used for these projects, namely:

<li>Project 1 -- CMPG323-Overview-35526734  *this Repo*<li/>
<li>Project 2 -- CMPG323-Project2-35526734<li/>
<li>Project 3 -- CMPG323-Project3-35526734<li/>
<li>Project 4 -- CMPG323-Project4-35526734<li/>
<li>Project 5 -- CMPG323-Project5-35526734<li/>


## How the Repositories will work. 
Each projects work will be encapsulated within its own repo.
Within Project 1's repo you can find a kanban board. There it precisely explains what tasks will be done when and to what repository wit will be linked.

## Brancing stratagy
As with industry standards a branching stratagy will be followed that include the main, development and features beneath it.

## What will be going on in the .gitignore file.
There may be multiple uses for this file, but mostly the main use is to store credentials that will otherwise not be seen by the public, and to exclude unneccessary files that is not needed for the repository.
